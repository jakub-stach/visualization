# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...
      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

- Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did:
I chose to classify this visualization as a bad one due to a number of factors which I will list below:
1) Information density - the visualization is far too much for our cognitive load, it crams a lot of information into a single image which makes it difficult for viewers to engage with and comprehend. The information lacks hierarchy which makes it difficult to see what the takeaways are and how to parse this information.
2) Color-coding issues - the gradient chosen for the percentages of internet adoption is not intuititve and seemingly far too course grained at times. The variations in color are sometimes not as clear as they should be which could present accessibility issues. The colours themselves do not add any interesting information or guide us towards a meaningful takeaway.
3) Context - the information is not contextualized properly, which could be because of the medium it's introduced in but also, it's not clear what the purpose of the visualization is to begin with.
4) Excessive detail - the country level data is too granular which makes it difficult to understand patterns within the chosen regions. The 100% club section and the line graph do not provide a meaningful enough context or narrative as to why they're important/relevant.  
5) Inappropriate label sizes - the region labels are too small a font and the separation line doesn't add to any clarity or clarify that those groups are the subgroups.

- How could this data visualization have been improved?
1) Focus on aggregating the data and then providing insights into individual countries as opposed to displaying all information at onces - this would give readers an ability to drill down for insights if they choose to do so.
2) Provide more information with annotations - this would allow the author to guide the readers to specific parts of the visualization that help them tell a story, and to provide additional context for the visualization.
3) Improve colour usage - while branding is important, it would be more helpful to have more finegrained colours usage and reliance on gradients within colours to help differentiate things (75% and up is too broad a category).

- Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did:
I chose to label this as the good visualization because it communicates comple data in a clear and engaging way that uses intuitive design elements to communicate it's information:
1) The layout is clear and focused: the visualization allows us to select from players on the left which then populates the shot chart to the right. The layout is clean, well-spaced, and doesn't have too many parts which allows the reader to focus and understand what's going on.
2) The interactivity is clear and limited. Great use of labels to indicate what the options are available to users and clear annotations and legends throughout.
3) The colours are clear and effective: red and blue communicate the player's shooting efficincie relative to the league average using blue and red to convey whether they're hotter or colder than the rest of the league which is the intuitive interpretation. 
4) Great use of context as base metric: by utilizing efficiency by location in relation to league average we can assess a player's effectiveness with a broader understanding of how they compare to other players. Having top 25 players (sans Lebron for some reason) allows us to get a better grasp of their efficiencies and limitations. 
- How could this data visualization have been improved?
Like any good piece of work, this visualization can be improved in the following ways:
1) Provide a clear legend or description for the shot chart scale - the colour efficincie is intuitive, having a grasp on what constitues the above or below average performance would show more of an impact on the reader's understanding of the player's efficiency.
2) Improve the gray - while it helps to not use too many coloours, in this case, the gray makes it appear as if those shots are ignored or "greyed out" which goes against clarity.
3) Provide a highlight of any specific outlier or extra success zones as this can emphasize certain insights.
4) Vary the sizes of the hexaogns more to highlight volume shot zones - while this is used in some capacity it'd be better to highlight the stark differences in volume between shots.
